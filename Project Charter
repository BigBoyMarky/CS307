Problem Statement:

Missing people and pets is a very common problem worldwide. Up until now, there has never been a centralized system that caters to both missing person reports and missing pet reports.  Current report systems are inefficient in communicating information to the general public.

Objectives:

Allow users to connect and post or report on a centralized and responsive system
Allow users to easily post missing people or pets with minimal effort
Generate real time software that satisfies the needs of users and is easy to use
Provide a way for people to communicate with status updates on the current search efforts
Provide a database with scalability to handle a large amount of data

Stakeholders:

Software developers creating the project
Potential user base
Families
Pet owners
The general public
Project coordinator

Deliverables:

A web based application that will provide an easy to use interface for reporting and viewing missing people or pets
We will also provide a mobile application with a user-friendly interface for reporting and viewing missing people or pets
A database to store all the reports that is scalable and secure
